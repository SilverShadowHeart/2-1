context switching what is context switching 
it happens when we have two concurrent processes

synchronization if the process executes in a order one after another then it is synchronization 

write a java program to create two threads first thread to read a file and print it on the screen and second thread for copying a file to another file synchronize the two threads such that the second thread runs first then the first?


mutual exclusion 
the task has to be executed one after another or inclusively 
no preemption 

once a process is started it can not be stopped 


hold and wait
one resource is being held and that process is waiting for another resource 

Circular wait: a closed chain of processes where each process holds at least one resource needed by the next process in the chain, forming a loop of waiting.
