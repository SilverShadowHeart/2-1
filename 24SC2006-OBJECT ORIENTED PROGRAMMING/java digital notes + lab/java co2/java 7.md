interfaces
 used for implementing multiple inheritance in java an interface in java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class 


key properties of interface 
the interface in java mechanism to achieve abstraction
by default variables in an interface are public static and final 
it is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java 
it supports loose coupling classes depend on behavior not implementation 
in other words interfaces primarily define methods tha --- 


write a java program to create an interface named as shape with the method area of type double and calculate the area of square rectangle and triangle using the same method area in different classes(square , rectangle , triangle  )
