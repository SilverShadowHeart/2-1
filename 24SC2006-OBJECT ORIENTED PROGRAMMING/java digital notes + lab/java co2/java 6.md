method overriding  it is also called as run time polymorphism 
overriding in java when a sub class or child class implements a method that is already defined in the superclass or base class when a subclass provides its own version of a method that

the subclass methods must match the  parent class method's name ,parameters, and return type

rules for overriding
java picks which method to run based on the  actual object type not just the variable type
static methods cannot be overridden
