hash map in java
a hash map is a part of java's collection framework and implements the map interface it stores elements in key value pairs where 

 keys are unique 
 values can be duplicated 
 data is stored using hashing for quick access ,insertion, and deletion internally uses hashing

key features of hashmap
not synchor
no dupes
hash map uses keys in the same wau as ana rrray uses index

overall time complexity o(1)


write a program to create a hashmap with rol and marks with 5 entires and print all the rols as an array an print all the values iterating through the hashmap and print the size of the hash map
