9.      Discuss few data science sample case studies

**Fraud Detection**

- **Goal:** Identify fraudulent activity **before it causes major damage**.
- **Approach:** Analyze historical data to detect patterns and anomalies.
- **Challenges:** Real-time detection is **harder than post-fact**, requires **high precision**.
- **Trade-offs:** Both false positives (innocent flagged) and false negatives (fraud missed) are costly.
- **Tech:** Stream processing, anomaly detection models, real-time dashboards, ML algorithms.

**Recommender Systems:**

- **Purpose:** Deliver **personalized suggestions** to users.
- **Impact:** Boosts sales, click-throughs, conversions.
- **Examples:**
    - **Netflix:** ~$1B/year value from recommendations.
    - **Amazon:** 20–35% annual sales lift.
- **Technique:** Collaborative filtering at scale, content-based methods, hybrid approaches.
