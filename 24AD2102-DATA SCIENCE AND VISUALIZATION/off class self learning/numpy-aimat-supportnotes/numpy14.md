## âœ… `np.partition()`

Returns a copy where the element at the **kth position is in the correct place**, and **all smaller are before, all larger after**, but not fully sorted.



`a = np.array([7, 3, 5, 1, 9]) np.partition(a, 2)  # [3, 1, 5, 7, 9]`

- 5 is the **2nd smallest** (index 2), so itâ€™s correctly positioned.
    
- Left side: values â‰¤ 5
    
- Right side: values â‰¥ 5
    
- But not necessarily sorted.

## âœ… `np.argpartition()`

Returns indices like `argsort`, but for `partition`.



`a = np.array([7, 3, 5, 1, 9]) ix = np.argpartition(a, 2)     # e.g., [1, 3, 2, 0, 4] a[ix]                          # [3, 1, 5, 7, 9]`

- Use when you want **top-k or bottom-k elements fast** (e.g. top-10 scores)

## âœ… When to use partition

- **Much faster** than full sort when you only care about a few top/bottom values
    
- Useful in ML, rankings, selection problems

Would you like a short demo code to include in your docs before we move to `np.unique()` and set operations?

### âœ… `np.partition()`: Half-sort (heap/tree logic)

- Think of it like a **binary heap or quickselect**.
    
- It ensures the **`k`th smallest element is in the correct final position**, with:
    
    - **Left**: values â‰¤ that element (but not sorted)
        
    - **Right**: values â‰¥ that element (also not sorted)
        

ðŸ”¹ Example:


`a = np.array([9, 1, 5, 3, 7]) out = np.partition(a, 2) print(out)  # [3, 1, 5, 9, 7] or [1, 3, 5, 9, 7] â†’ 5 is at index 2`

---

### âœ… `np.argpartition()`: Just gives the **index positions**

- Not values, just where theyâ€™d be if you partitioned
    
- Think of it as a "reordering map"
    

ðŸ”¹ Example:



`a = np.array([9, 1, 5, 3, 7]) ix = np.argpartition(a, 2) print(ix)        # [3, 1, 2, 0, 4] print(a[ix])     # [3, 1, 5, 9, 7]`

You can then apply it like:


`# Get 3 smallest values smallest_3 = a[np.argpartition(a, 3)[:3]]`

---

It's a **partial heap-like structure**, optimized for **selection** not sorting.
