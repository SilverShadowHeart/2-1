skewness pearson's median skewness 

what is skew ness
skewness quantifies the asymmetry of a probability distribution around its mean it tells us which way the distribution leans and how pronounced that lean is 

when analyzing data skewness help us understand 

if outliers tend to appear in a particular direction
how central tendency measures relate to each other
what transformations might normalize our data 


types of skewness: visual and concept overview


# negative skewness 
tail extends to the left

mean < median < mode

example exam scores in an easy test 

note : a diagram 
# zero skewness
symmetrical distribution in a homogeneous population 

mean = median = mode 

example height distribution in a homogeneous population
note : a diagram 
# positive skew
tail extends to  the right
mean > median > mode 

example income distribution 
note : a diagram 

# why skewness matters in data science 

## model validity

many statistical methods (t tests , anova , linear regression ) for normally distributed data skewed data can invalidate these assumptions 

## feature engineering 
helps identify when and how to transform variables (log, square root box cox) to improve model performance 

## risk assessment
in finance and insurance understanding skewness is crucial for accurate risk modeling and portfolio management
