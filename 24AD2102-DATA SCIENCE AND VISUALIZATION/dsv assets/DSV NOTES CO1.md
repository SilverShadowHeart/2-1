```

**Data Collection:** Gathering raw data from various sources, such as databases, sensors, or user interactions.

**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.

**Data Analysis:** Applying statistical and computational methods to identify patterns, trends, or relationships.

**Data Visualization:** Creating charts, graphs, and dashboards to present findings clearly.

**Decision-Making:** Using insights to inform strategies, create solutions, or predict outcomes.

Q Difference Between Data Science and Data Visualization?

**Data Science:** Full pipeline—collecting, cleaning, analyzing, modeling data, extracting insights, and making predictions or decisions. Encompasses stats, ML, programming, and domain knowledge.

**Data Visualization:** Subset/tool of data science—focuses on representing data visually (charts, graphs, dashboards) to communicate insights effectively. Doesn’t inherently analyze or predict.
