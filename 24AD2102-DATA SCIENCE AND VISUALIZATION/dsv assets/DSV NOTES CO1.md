```

**Data Collection:** Gathering raw data from various sources, such as databases, sensors, or user interactions.

**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.

**Data Analysis:** Applying statistical and computational methods to identify patterns, trends, or relationships.

**Data Visualization:** Creating charts, graphs, and dashboards to present findings clearly.

**Decision-Making:** Using insights to inform strategies, create solutions, or predict outcomes.

Q Difference Between Data Science and Data Visualization?

**Data Science:** Full pipeline—collecting, cleaning, analyzing, modeling data, extracting insights, and making predictions or decisions. Encompasses stats, ML, programming, and domain knowledge.

**Data Visualization:** Subset/tool of data science—focuses on representing data visually (charts, graphs, dashboards) to communicate insights effectively. Doesn’t inherently analyze or predict.



<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">(or)</p>

**Data Science:** Data science is study of data. It involves developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to extract useful information

**Data Visualization:** Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format(Example: charts, graphs, and maps).

<p align="center" style="font-size:24px">Data science work flow and life cycle</p>
<p align="center" style="font-size:24px">difference between data science and big data</p>

- **Data Science:** Focused on **analyzing data** to extract insights, build models, and make decisions. Uses statistics, ML, and visualization.
    
- **Big Data:** Refers to **massive, complex datasets** (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) that traditional tools can’t handle efficiently. Focus is on **storage, processing, and management**.

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">(or)</p>

**Data Science:**

1. Extracts insights from structured and unstructured data.
    
2. Uses statistics, machine learning, and visualization.
    
3. Focuses on solving problems and making predictions.
    
4. Works with datasets of any size, not necessarily huge.
    

**Big Data:**

1. Deals with massive, high-velocity, and diverse datasets.
    
2. Focuses on storage, processing, and management.
    
3. Enables scalable analysis, often using distributed systems.
    
4. Infrastructure-centric; insights require additional tools like data science.

**Fraud Detection **

- **Goal:** Identify fraudulent activity **before it causes major damage**.
    
- **Approach:** Analyze historical data to detect patterns and anomalies.
    
- **Challenges:** Real-time detection is **harder than post-fact**, requires **high precision**.
    
- **Trade-offs:** Both false positives (innocent flagged) and false negatives (fraud missed) are costly.
    
- **Tech:** Stream processing, anomaly detection models, real-time dashboards, ML algorithms.

---

**Recommender Systems:**

- **Purpose:** Deliver **personalized suggestions** to users.
    
- **Impact:** Boosts sales, click-throughs, conversions.
    
- **Examples:**
