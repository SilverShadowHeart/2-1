Q Difference Between Data Science and Data Visualization?

**Data Science:** Full pipeline—collecting, cleaning, analyzing, modeling data, extracting insights, and making predictions or decisions. Encompasses stats, ML, programming, and domain knowledge.

**Data Visualization:** Subset/tool of data science—focuses on representing data visually (charts, graphs, dashboards) to communicate insights effectively. Doesn’t inherently analyze or predict.



<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">(or)</p>

**Data Science:** Data science is study of data. It involves developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to extract useful information

**Data Visualization:** Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format(Example: charts, graphs, and maps).

![[Pasted image 20250815123547.png]]

### import
In Python, the `import` statement brings external modules or libraries into your code, giving access to their functions, classes, and variables so you don’t have to rewrite common functionality.

Examples:

```python
import math         # full module 
from math import pi # specific item 
import numpy as np   # alias for convenience
```

It’s essential for code reuse, modularity, and leveraging Python’s ecosystem.

---

### dir Function in Python

The `dir()` function is used to list all the attributes (variables, functions, classes, etc.) of a module or object. It helps you explore what a module contains.

Example with the `math` module

```python
import math
print(dir(math))
```

<p align="center" style="font-size:24px"><b>NUMPY</b></p>

What is NumPy?

NumPy (short for Numerical Python ) is one of the most fundamental libraries in Python for scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays.

<p align="center" style="font-size:16px">(or)</p>

NumPy provides high-performance tools for working with arrays and matrices. Unlike standard Python lists, it supports multi-dimensional data and a rich collection of mathematical operations, making it a foundational library in the data science ecosystem.

It provides support for:

- Multi-dimensional arrays (called ndarray)

- Mathematical operations (linear algebra, statistics, etc.)

- Vectorization for fast computation (avoids Python loops)


#### CREATING AN ARRAY 

 NumPy `array()` Function

The `numpy.array()` function is used to create a NumPy array from a Python list, tuple, or other sequence-like objects. It converts data into an `ndarray` for efficient numerical operations.


Syntax 
(you dont need all)
```python
numpy.array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0)
```

```python

import numpy as np                                       
arr = np.array ( [1,2,3,4,5])  
# Displaying ID array
print (arr)
```
**output:**
```
[1 2 3 4 5]
```

```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array ( [1,2,3,4,5])
# Displaying ID array
for item in arr:
    print (item)
```
