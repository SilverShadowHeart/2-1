line plots density counter plot histogram and binning 

skewness positive skewness and karl pearson skewness statical inference hypothesis's testing  python list and arrays any question on this  differentiate list and arrays single dimension arrays and multidimensional sorting (work book style sort by index sort by value sorting by single column and sorting by multiple columns ) broadcasting refer the ppts and then reshaping of arrays series and data frame  and then vertical stacking and horizonal stacking multilevel grouping single level grouping (group by function ) aggregations time series datatime64 time data64 slicing and filtering and then indexing by position based or label based loc and iloc  then coming to the visualization line plot when why sample py code and also draw the graph scatter plot density plot counter plots histograms and binning  


also important for the end sem aexam as well 



### **High-Weight Exam Topics**

**A. Descriptive Statistics & Data Basics**

- Skewness
    
- Positive skewness
    
- Karl Pearson’s coefficient of skewness
    

**B. Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing**

- Concepts of population, sample, sampling
    
- Null and alternative hypotheses
    
- Type I & Type II errors
    
- Confidence interval
    
- Level of significance
    
- One-tail and two-tail tests
    
- Large and small sample tests
    
- Degrees of freedom
    

**C. Python & Data Structures**

- Python lists vs NumPy arrays
    
- Single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
    
- Indexing (position-based, label-based)
    
- Slicing and filtering (`loc`, `iloc`)
    
- Broadcasting
    
- Reshaping of arrays, Series, and DataFrames
    
- Vertical and horizontal stacking
    

**D. Sorting & Grouping**

- Sorting by index and by value
    
- Sorting by single and multiple columns (workbook style)
    
- Single-level and multi-level grouping (`groupby`)
    
- Aggregations
    

**E. Time-Series Data**

- `datetime64`, `timedelta64` types
    
- Time-based indexing and slicing
    

**F. Data Visualization (Python / Matplotlib / Seaborn)**

- **Line plot** – when & why, sample Python code, graph interpretation
    
- **Scatter plot** – relationship between two variables
    
- **Density plot / Contour plot** – distribution visualization
    
- **Histogram & Binning** – frequency distribution
    
- Basic visualization parameters (title, labels, legend, color, style)
