What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power,
database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet
with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as
hardware, and instead think of (and use) it as software.
•
Infrastructure as hardware
Hardware solutions:
•
•
Require space, staff, physical
security, planning, capital
expenditure
Have a long hardware procurement
cycle
Require you to provision capacity by
guessing theoretical maximum
peaks

Infrastructure as software
Software solutions:
Are flexible
Can change more quickly, easily,
and cost-effectively than hardware
solutions
Eliminate the undifferentiated
heavy-lifting tasks
